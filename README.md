# Countdown Board For Project Management Using Reactjs and Firebase

## Objective
Develop a countdown board web application for project management. The board helps manage tasks by dividing them into three sections: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**. The application supports user authentication and task history tracking.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Login** and **Sign Up** functionalities.
- Secure user registration and login to access the countdown board.

### 2. Task Sections
- Three sections on the board:
  - **To Do**: For tasks that need to be started.
  - **In Progress**: For tasks currently being worked on.
  - **Completed**: For tasks that have been finished.

### 3. Task Management
- Users can **add tasks** to any section (To Do, In Progress, Completed).
- **Drag-and-drop** functionality:
  - Users can move tasks between sections by dragging and dropping them.
- Buttons for adding new tasks to the board.

### 4. Task History
- System to **track task history**:
  - Record when a task is added, when it moves to "In Progress," and when it is marked as "Completed."
  - Display the history of each task for user review.

### 5. UI/UX Considerations
- User-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- Responsive design that works well on both web and mobile devices.
